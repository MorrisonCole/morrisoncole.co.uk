On September 26th, 2022, I released a new EP — Apart — under Latent Signal.

The tracks were composed remotely during the first COVID lockdowns. They began
life as piano voice memos from Elliot in London which I then cleaned up,
arranged and mixed in Tokyo. They were first posted on YouTube under different
names, then eventually released as this EP.
