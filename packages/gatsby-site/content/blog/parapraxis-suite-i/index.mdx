Today I re-released an EP I originally wrote and recorded back in **2012** for a
game I was working on with my game studio Third Nerve.

At the time, we were all students and had _very_ little experience with game
development. We had something resembling a game, but it wasn't anywhere near
suitable for an alpha release. More importantly, we weren't sure when it would
be. Since the only thing I knew how to ship was music, I wrote this EP in order
try and build a bit of excitement.

I remember taking these small zine-like booklets with some concept art and
download codes for the EP to a Brighton game festival. I gave one to Peter
Molyneux and tracked his code for weeks before conceding that he'd probably
never download it. Not sure if he ever did.

Although the game was one of the first to be approved on Steam Greenlight, like
many at the time... we never actually finished it. We _did_ manage an alpha with
a few levels and multiplayer support, took it to some game festivals and things,
but ultimately didn't quite make it to the finish line.

I guess my ideal of releasing the game with a 'pay what you can afford' scheme
didn't really fund our efforts and the real-life career stuff eventually got in
the way. Sadly there was never really an end - we just gradually disbanded.

Since we did this first though, the EP survives!

On a personal note - I think this is the only music I've ever written that
people actually paid for ðŸ˜… (thanks
[Bandcamp](https://morrisoncole.bandcamp.com/)). I seem to remember making $7
and being thrilled. In fact, I'm still thrilled. Someone even reviewed it!

Anyways, here it is, 10 years later with a slightly better master.

P.S., although most were never released, I wrote a tonne of songs for the to-be
game. One other song survived and made it out as 'From Parapraxis' which I
recorded as a music video with Latent Signal.
