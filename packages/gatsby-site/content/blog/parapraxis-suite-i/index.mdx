On November 23rd, 2022, I re-released an EP I originally wrote and recorded back
in 2012 for a game I was working on with my game studio â€” Third Nerve â€” at the
time.

Although the game was one of the first to be approved on Steam Greenlight, like
many at the time... we never actually finished it. We did manage an alpha with a
few levels and multiplayer support, took it to some game festivals etc., but
didn't quite make it to the finish line. I guess my ideal of releasing the game
with a 'pay what you can afford' scheme didn't really fund our efforts and work
eventually got in the way. We sadly just gradually disbanded.

The music survives though! This EP was the first thing we released â€” even before
the game â€” and was put up on [Bandcamp](https://morrisoncole.bandcamp.com/)
originally.

I think this is the only music I wrote that people actually paid for ðŸ˜…. I seem
to remember making $7 and being thrilled. Someone even reviewed it!

> [Propuesta Cultural](https://bandcamp.com/propuesta): The work of this multi-instrumentalist suggests not only
> passion and discipline, but a musical language accessible to all.

Anyways, here it is, 10 years later with a slightly better master. Can't believe
I'm that old really!
