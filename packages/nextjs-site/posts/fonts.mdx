# Fonts

When I decided to build this website, I wanted to write my performance tests
first.

For years I've had a personal website. It gets a really small amount of traffic,
but it's fun as a learning tool and keeps me engaged on rainy days. The software
engineering I get paid for has almost never included anything that could be
considered frontend, so there's that too.

So, naively following the advice of some random blogposts, I self-hosted my
fonts! Everything seemed great, and lighthouse-ci seemed very happy. Things were
fast!

Then I tried to introduce a Japanese font.

https://github.com/MorrisonCole/morrisoncole.co.uk/commit/93eafdf2fd19caff51256326860b8e19b5c7bb1a

Oh no:

```
  âœ˜  total-byte-weight failure for minScore assertion
       Avoid enormous network payloads
       https://web.dev/total-byte-weight/

        expected: >=0.9
           found: 0.67
      all values: 0.67, 0.67, 0.67
```

OK, so the woff2 I used contains just about every character under the sun, and
it's _huge_. 1.7MB! This font is over 100x larger than my latin character set.

By they way, I wrote about testing performance first before, but the truth is I
probably wouldn't have even noticed this if my tests hadn't started failing
right away.

- Performance tests in CI are fantastic.
- Don't blindly preload everything. Really consider what you need to prioritise.
- Google Fonts has some really cool features for font compatability and speed,
  so I'd recommend using it by default, but if you do have the time and
  patience, it's going to be faster to host the fonts yourself.
