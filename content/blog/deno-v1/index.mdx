### Deno

![Deno Launch Art](./deno_art.jpg)

Aside from the fact I can't disassociate the name of this tool from that of an
[extraordinarily talented ex-colleague](https://twitter.com/DinoWernli), Deno is
all new to me.

It's basically a way to ship sandboxed TypeScript as a single executable. You
can think of it like a cross-platform headless browser, with package manager
built in.

Deno is a Node successor in the sense that it has been designed to iterate on it
for a new generation of JavaScript & TypeScript APIs, but it's probably no where
near as stable yet. Node is ooooold. Deno is brand spanking new!

### MDX With Frontmatter to MDX With Exports

When I first created this blog, I used to provide custom metadata for each post
like this:

```
---
title: Hello, deno!
path: /hello-deno
date: 2019-05-14
---
```

It's just YAML (which is fine), but it's possible (and slightly more fun) to
define an export with JS like this:

```
export const meta = {
  "title": "Hello, deno!",
  "path": "/hello-deno",
  "date": "2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Christopher Biscardi ([@chrisbiscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi))
posted a
[handy little Node script](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/convert-mdx-with-frontmatter-to-mdx-with-exports)
to automate the migration a while back, and since I used it, I thought it would
be a nice candidate for rewriting with Deno.

Here's the final thing
([frontmatter-to-exports.ts](https://github.com/MorrisonCole/morrisoncole.co.uk/blob/develop/content/blog/deno-v1/frontmatter-to-exports.ts)):

```
import { parseAll } from "https://deno.land/std@0.51.0/encoding/yaml.ts";

let mdxDirectory = "./";

console.log(`Reading from directory: ${mdxDirectory}`);

for await (const file of Deno.readDir(mdxDirectory)) {
  if (!file.name.endsWith("mdx")) continue;
  console.log(`\n\nConverting '${file.name}':`);

  let content = await Deno.readTextFile("./example.mdx");

  let yaml = parseAll(content) as object[];
  const output = `export const meta = ${JSON.stringify(yaml[0], null, 2)}`;
  console.log(output);
}
```

Run it with: `deno --allow-read frontmatter-to-exports.ts`

There are a few differences from the original. Namely, it doesn't actually write
the modified file back out. I did try to implement that, but without getting
into some regex schenanigans, it wasn't particularly easy.

### Problems

To be honest, this took me _way_ longer than I expected to write, but it was a
lot of fun.

#### TypeScript & Iterables

First I spent a while trying to write something vaguely functional-looking
([thread](https://twitter.com/morrisoncole/status/1261064635819548672)), but
gave up.

To be honest though, I think I'm kind of spoiled by Kotlin. The alternative I
went with is just as readable anyway!

#### Ecosystem (Or... Lack Thereof)

Secondly I tried to figure out how to import some JS from the web but got this
mysterious error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot resolve extension for "https://unpkg.com/browse/front-matter@3.2.1/index.js" with mediaType "Unknown".
```

Really crappy error but I finally figured out to add `-Ldebug` to Deno, then got
a nicer stacktrace:

```
⚠️️ Granted network access to
"https://unpkg.com/browse/front-matter@3.2.1/index.d.ts" unknown content type:
text/html; charset=utf-8
```

Turns out I was pointing at the wrong file, obviously I needed the raw one 🤦‍♂️.

As the Deno ecosystem develops (or the [NPM shim](https://deno.land/std/node/)
gets finished), I'm sure this will get much easier!
