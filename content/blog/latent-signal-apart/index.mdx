On September 26th, 2022, I released a new EP â€” Apart â€” under
[Latent Signal](https://linktr.ee/latentsignal).

The tracks were composed remotely during the first COVID lockdowns. They began
life as piano voice memos from Elliot in London which I then cleaned up,
arranged and mixed in Tokyo. They were first posted on YouTube under different
names, then eventually released as this EP.

Remote collaboration has been necessary (but difficult) since I moved to Japan.
This was the first time we actually managed to finish something given the
circumstances.
