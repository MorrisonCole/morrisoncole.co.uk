Almost exactly one year ago, I stuffed my carry-on with ~73 boxes of Fluoxetine
(Prozac) and left for Heathrow airport.

My decision to move to Japan was somewhat spontaneous ‚Äì long-term planning
wasn't really a concern during the insane uprooting of my UK life to this
country on the other side of the planet ‚Äì but one thing I _did_ manage to get
right was the medical preparation.

Medical preparation for a year, that is, because the availability of modern
antidepressants in Japan turned out to be... somewhat lacking.

This subject, and indeed that of mental health in general here in Japan,
deserves a great deal more coverage and discussion, but since I am working with
a limited capacity to understand Japanese so it's possible I've completely
overlooked verious things - please reach out to me
([@MorrisonCole](https://twitter.com/morrisoncole)) if you have any corrections
and/or suggestions!

### I: Back to the 80s

![Star Wars Japanese Posters](./80s.jpg)

Although antidepressants are
[still not very good](<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#fig3>)
in general, there is little doubt that they are an effective first line
treatment for depression. In fact, there are so many drugs available that we
normally just refer to them by their mechanism (presumably in order to avoid
having to blurt out weird and wonderful compound names during patient-doctor
conversations).

The most common of these categories are SSRIs. These are what you're likely to
be prescribed if you visit your doctor in Europe for that difficult but
oh-so-necessary depression chat.

I've taken two SSRIs since I first got help for major depressive disorder a few
years ago - Citalopram and Fluoxetine. Since 2018 I've been on varying dosages
of the latter, but I was surprised to discover while researching this post that
it was actually first legalised in the US all the way back in 1988! üë¥üèº I chose
the drug with the advice of my doctor, but in general, Fluoxetine seems to be a
fairly safe bet. It has a better-than-placebo dropout rate due to adverse events
and significant efficacy.

I'd forgive you for assuming that a 32 year old antidepressant would be
available here in Japan, but you would be wrong. Japan is a time warp sometimes,
and mental health is no exception.

### II: ‰Ωï„Åù„ÇåÔºüÁæéÂë≥„Åó„ÅÑ„ÅÆÔºü

None of the antidepressants I was familiar with in the UK are available here -
most have either failed to be approved or simply given up any effort to enter
the Japanese market, so when I first looked over the list with my doctor before
I left, I didn't recognise anything.

That's not to say that there are no antidepressants available - the first SSRI
to be approved in Japan was Fluvoxamine (treats OCD) in 1999 (incidentally, 5
years after it entered the US market) - and more have been approved since.

The newest (2010) and most widely-prescribed (as of 2017) seems to be an SNRI
named _Duloxetine_, which seems to have a fairly high rate of adverse events,
but also decent efficacy when taken to.

### III: Entering Japan

One of the words forever burned into my long-term memory is Ëñ¨Áõ£Ë®ºÊòé
('pharmatist certificate'). While it's not possible to buy or be prescribed
Fluoxetine here, you can actually import it on arrival. Yes, that means you have
to take it _with you on the plane_ as you move, along with this certificate.

Prior to departure, you must send an application form to the 'Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare' and get import permission.

_Naturally, I brought a years supply with me:_

I'll never forget the look on the two custom's officers faces as I arrived at
KIX with a bag literally full of Fluoxetine. With true Japanese attention to
detail, they dilligently counted each and every box, before giving me the all
clear.

### IV: A New Hope

As for me, my Fluoxetine supplies are
[dwindling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvyP4Q870ZQ&feature=youtu.be&t=177)
and I'll soon be faced with the two rather unattractive options of either **a)**
navigating the prescription process in Japan and transitioning to a different
drug, or **b)** coming off altogether.

Thankfully though, there are at least _some_ options here, and whilst the whole
process is slightly intimidating, it's part of what makes living in another
country so interesting!
