My decision to move to Japan was somewhat spontaneous ‚Äì long-term planning wasn't 
really a concern during the insane uprooting of my UK life to this country on the 
other side of the planet ‚Äì but one thing I _did_ manage to get right was the medical preparation.

Medical preparation for a year, that is, because the availability of modern anti-depressants in Japan is... somewhat lacking.

This subject, and indeed that of mental health in general here in Japan, deserves a great deal more coverage and 
discussion, but I am working with a limited capacity to understand Japanese so it's possible I've completely overlooked 
some things - please reach out to me ([@MorrisonCole](https://twitter.com/morrisoncole)) if you have any corrections and/or suggestions!

### I: Back to the 80s

Although antidepressants are [still not very good](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext#fig3) in general, there appears to be little doubt that those commonly prescribed nowadays can have significant effects. There are so many drugs available that we normally just refer to them by their mechanism, presumably in order to avoid having to blurt out weird and wonderful compound names during patient-doctor conversations.

The most common category are SSRIs. These are what you're likely to be prescribed if you visit your doctor in Europe for that difficult but oh-so-necessary depression chat.

I've taken two SSRIs since I first got help for major depressive disorder a few years ago - Citalopram and Fluoxetine. Since 2018 I've been on varying dosages of the latter, but I was surprised to discover while researching this post that it was actually first legalised in the US all the way back in 1988! üë¥üèº I chose the drug with the advice of my doctor, but in general, Fluoxetine seems to be a fairly safe bet. It has a better-than-placebo dropout rate due to adverse events and significant efficacy.

I'd forgive you for assuming that a 32 year old antidepressant would be available here in Japan, but you would be wrong. Japan is a time warp sometimes, and mental health is no exception.

### II: ‰Ωï„Åù„ÇåÔºüÁæéÂë≥„Åó„ÅÑ„ÅÆÔºü

None of the antidepressants I was familiar with in the UK are available here - most have either failed to be approved or simply given up any effort to enter the Japanese market, so when I first looked over the list with my doctor before I left, I didn't recognise anything.

That's not to say that there are no antidepressants available - the first SSRI to be approved in Japan was Fluvoxamine (treats OCD) in 1999 (incidentally, 5 years after it entered the US market) - and more have been approved since.

The newest (2010) and most widely-prescribed (as of 2017) seems to be an SNRI named *Duloxetine*, which seems to have a fairly high rate of adverse events, but also decent efficacy when taken to.

As for me, my Fluoxetine supplies are [dwindling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvyP4Q870ZQ&feature=youtu.be&t=177) and I'll soon be faced with the two rather unattractive options of either **a)** navigating the prescription process in Japan and transitioning to a different drug, or **b)** simple coming off altogether. Since I've tried coming off a few times before for other reasons with generally terrible results, I'll probably try the former. Expect an update once I sort *that* mess out!
